### Task: Apply the specified unsupervised ML algorithms on the given dataset
- K Means CLustering ( Find the value of k using Elbow method)
- Hierarchical clustering
- DBSCAN (Find the value of Eps(Radius) and MinNeighbour)

The Dataset provided does not contain any missing data so no need for EDA

**Note: For the clustering algorithms, u are supposed to use only the last 3 columns( maths score, reading score, writing score)**
After applying every algorithm u are supposed to plot the clustering graphs and other necessary graphs
1. Kmeans: Elbow Method Graph and the clustering Graph
2. Hierarchical Clustering: dendrogram and the clustering graph
3. DBSCAN : The clustering graph.
