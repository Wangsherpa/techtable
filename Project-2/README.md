# Project-2
### Tasks: 
1. Apply the specified Supervised ML Algorithm using the provided  Dataset
2. The ML Algorithm to be applied in the project are
 - Support Vector Machines
 - Logistic Regression
 - K Nearest Neighbours
 - Decision Tree
 - The Dataset provided contains missing data. in order to make it usable,u need to apply necessary Missing value handling  Techniques
3.Apply Encoding methods in order to make it compatible for the models

**Task Results:** The Project should find the accuracy of different models trained on the DataSet and show the comparison between them
